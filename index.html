                    <h1>Hello!</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p> My name is Emily Doan and I am a Public Health graduate from the
                        University of Washington. Along with my Bachelor of Arts in Public Health, I also have a
                        minor
                        in
                        English. I currently reside in Seattle with my two fur babies, King and Mimi.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, watching anime, and playing video games.
                        Currently,
                        I am working through Witcher 3, Dark Souls 3, and Zelda:Breath of the Wild. Occasionally,
                        you
                        can
                        find me on Overwatch or League of Legends.
                        <br>

                        After building my first computer this past summer, I began having interest in not only the
                        hardware
                        side of computers, but also the software side. Thus, my journey towards becoming a web
                        developer
                        begins here.</p>
